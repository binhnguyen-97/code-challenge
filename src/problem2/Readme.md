# Problem 2: Swap form

The solution can be found in the `token-swapper` folder nested in this folder

Since I'm working in `Svelte` at this moment and found that `Svelte` is a better choice for this problem compare to `React`. It's a best choice for small application like this problem.
It also has same concept with `React`: props, state, for loop for rendering...
